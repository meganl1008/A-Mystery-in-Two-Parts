## SQL Challenge

Objective: to demonstrate data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis skills.
[technologies utilized: PostgreSQL, Pandas, Matplotlib]

<b> Step 1: Data Modeling </b>
- Inspect 6 different CSVs and sketch out an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) of the tables

<b> Step 2: Data Engineering </b>
- Create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
- Import each CSV file into the corresponsing SQL table

<b> Step 3: Data Analysis </b>

Preformed the following queries:
- List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary
- List employees who were hired in 1986
- List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager’s employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates
- List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- List all employees whose first name is “Hercules” and last names begin with “B”
- List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name
- In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name

<b> Step 4: Generate Data Visualizations (used Python) </b>
- Import the SQL database into Pandas 
- Created data visualizations to analyze salary ranges against employee attributes
